# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview
This project explores Pascal's Triangle, a fascinating mathematical construct that has numerous applications in mathematics, combinatorics, and computer science. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two numbers immediately above it. This project provides an implementation of Pascal's Triangle generation in Python, along with explanations and code examples.

### Pascal's Triangle
What is Pascal's Triangle?
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers immediately above it. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known to Chinese mathematicians over 500 years earlier.

### Key Properties
- The first and last numbers in each row are always 1.
- Each number in the interior of the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.
- Pascal's Triangle is symmetric.
- The sum of the numbers in each row is a power of 2.

### Usage
The primary usage of this project is to generate and display Pascal's Triangle. You can run the provided Python script to generate and print the triangle.

python pascals_triangle.py
Feel free to modify the script or use Pascal's Triangle in your own Python programs as needed.
